        "      \"content\": \"FULL SPOILER-FREE REVIEW @ https://fandomwire.com/aquaman-and-the-lost-kingdom-review/\\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Aquaman and the Lost Kingdom is a 'fine' farewell to the DCEU. Jason Momoa and Patrick Wilson's amusing chemistry offers plenty of entertaining moments, as their characters' complex relationship takes center stage as the primary thematic force. Mostly consistent from a visual standpoint, featuring well-executed set pieces that will leave the more action-addicted fans satisfied.\\r\\n\\r\\nNevertheless, the overreliance on exposition, a messy narrative structure, and other minor yet questionable decisions detract from the overall cohesiveness of the story. As the final installment, it's a pretty accurate mirror that reflects the highs and lows of the cinematic universe as a whole.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhile far from a mind-blowing send-off, it encapsulates the essence of the DCEU - a journey filled with few triumphs, many missed opportunities, and incomprehensible disasters.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nRating: B-\",\n" +

        "      \"content\": \"So here's good old \\\"Arthur\\\" (Jason Momoa) sitting around the house playing nursemaid to his young son with his wife \\\"Mera\\\" (Amber Heard) whilst all in his underwater kingdom is peaceful. Well not for long! \\\"Black Manta\\\" (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II) is still a tad narked after the last film (five years ago!) and now armed with an useful geek \\\"Dr. Shin\\\" (Randall Park) sets out to discover a secret trident that will enable him to destroy \\\"Atlantis\\\" altogether and maybe also release the long captive \\\"Kordax\\\" (wasn't that the stuff they used to make telephone cables from?) to help make his revenge complete. Initially hopelessly outgunned by his nemesis's sonic gun, he has to resort to the drastic step of rescuing his imprisoned brother \\\"Orm\\\" (Patrick Wilson) - whom you may recall he was instrumental in deposing and incarcerating in the first place; and hoping that he will join forces with them, \\\"Atlanna\\\" (Nicole Kidman) and \\\"King Nereus\\\" (an almost unrecognisable Dolph Lundgren). With battles lines drawn the films goes from \\\"Narnia\\\" to \\\"Middle Earth\\\" via the \\\"Lost World\\\" and even a bit of \\\"Ice Station Zebra\\\" for a series of ploddingly slow and disappointing set-piece adventures. To be fair, the last half hour does lift the pace a little, but by then I'm not sure if it wasn't all just a rather too late. Momoa is trying very hard here, but he's no Dwayne Johnson, and even the dulcets of John Rhys-Davies as the \\\"Brine King\\\" - with or without his claw - can't really raise this from it's pretty weak and feeble doldrums. Of course it looks good, loads of quality CGI and visual effects, but the story is light and overly strung out for two hours that really did feel more like two days at times. It's harmless fodder for Christmas cinema with very little to actually dislike about it - it's just the latest in a series of equally forgettable super-hero films that I suspect will leave no impact at all in the snow afterwards.\",\n" +
